[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/14127/WMD-Bath/rvo.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/14127/WMD-Bath/rvo)

## Introduction ##

This is supporting information and a reference implemention of the RVO method.

## Contents ##

* **rvo.py** The main program file. May be used interactively; run `rvo.py -h` for usage information.

* **rvo_stats.py** Simulates the use of RVO with large sets of energy-volume curves.
Used to generate the figures for a research paper. Data files will be released on publication.
Run `rvo_stats.py -h` for usage information.

## Contents ##

* **dvxc.py** The main program file. May be used interactively; run `dvxc -h` for usage information.

* **dvxc_stats.py** Simulates the use of Î”V<sub>xc</sub> with large sets of energy-volume curves.
Used to generate the figures for an in-progress research paper. Data files will be released on publication. Run `dvxc -h` for usage information.

* **ase_generate_input.py** Generates an energy-volume curve for use with rvo.py, given a set of crystal structure files. Supports [file formats known to ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/io.html#module-ase.io).

* **interpolate_cell.py** Collection of functions used to interpolate lattice vectors to a target volume.

* **data/(files).dat** Cu4SnS4.dvxc.dat is provided as an example input file. This is an unpublished E-V curve for an interesting ternary chalcogenide.

* **interpolation_scheme.pdf** Supporting information; mathematical derivation of interpolation scheme used by **interpolate_cell.py**. The LaTeX source file is also provided.

## Requirements ##

Python 2.7 with Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.
Testing has largely been on unix-like filesystems; there may be some issues on Windows relating to file paths.

The [Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (ASE) is required for the "ase_generate_input" program.
